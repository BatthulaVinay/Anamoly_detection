# Anomaly Detection using Machine Learning (CRISP-DM Approach)

## Overview
This project implements anomaly detection techniques to identify unusual patterns or outliers in a dataset. Following the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) methodology, it combines structured analysis with hands-on machine learning to detect anomalies effectively.

## Objectives
- Apply the CRISP-DM framework to guide anomaly detection
- Preprocess and explore real-world data
- Build and evaluate unsupervised models to detect anomalies
- Visualize patterns, trends, and outliers

## Dataset
- Typical features might include timestamps, numerical sensor data, or categorical tags
- The target is to identify outliers that deviate significantly from normal behavior

## CRISP-DM Process
1. **Business Understanding**
   - Define the anomaly detection goals (fraud, fault detection, etc.)

2. **Data Understanding**
   - Load data
   - Summarize and visualize key distributions
   - Identify missing or suspicious values

3. **Data Preparation**
   - Handle nulls and irrelevant features
   - Encode categorical variables if necessary
   - Normalize or scale features

4. **Modeling**
   - Use unsupervised models such as:
     - Isolation Forest
     - One-Class SVM
     - Local Outlier Factor (LOF)
   - Train models to detect anomalies

5. **Evaluation**
   - Visualize anomalies
   - Compare against any known labels or thresholds
   - Metrics: precision, recall (if labeled), or anomaly score distributions

6. **Deployment (Optional)**
   - Package model for real-time use in a pipeline
   - Streamlit or Flask interface for monitoring

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Optional: PyOD, Plotly

## How to Run
1. Clone this repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/anomaly-detection-crispdm.git
   cd anomaly-detection-crispdm
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```

3. Launch the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. Open and run:  
   `Anomaly_Detection_CRISPDM_Vinay.ipynb`

## Results
- Detected several key outliers using Isolation Forest
- Visualizations helped explain anomaly patterns
- CRISP-DM structure maintained clarity and repeatability of the analysis

## Future Improvements
- Add autoencoder-based deep learning models
- Use real-time data streams for live anomaly detection
- Deploy in a dashboard with alerts and logging
